            <h3>Product Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              Importing the data from excel files into SharePoint lists has always been difficult. The built in feature can only do so by creating a new list.
              That is why we developed this product, to help SharePoint users to import their data into exsiting lists. With this tool, you can select the files on your computer, and then do some fields mapping, after that you can just start importing.
              This is a SharePoint add-in, and it supports SharePoint Online, SharePoint 2013, SharePoint 2016.

                After all the configuration is set up, you may start importing. And during the process, the page is going to show you the progreass on a popup dialog.
                And whenever there is an error happed, you can see the failed rows on this popup dialog. And if you hover your mouse on the failed item, you may see the error message explaining why it was failed.
                The apperance of the failed ones does not stop the importing.
              </li>
              <li>
And at the current moment, once the importing started, you have to wait until it is done. But after the importing is finished on all the items, you can see a button called "Revert".
With this button, you can delete the items you just imported.
              </li>
              <li>During the process of importing, there is no button for you to stop this process. But you can do so by close or refresh this page, but it means you lost the posibility to delete the items you just imported with the "Revert" button we provided.</li>

        <h3>Questions About Purchasing and Sales</h3>
        <div>
            <h4>How long do trial versions of your software last? When do they start?</h4>
            <p>Currently, trials of our products run for 30 days, and begin when the product is installed.</p>

            <h4>Which payment methods does BluePower accept?</h4>
            <p>You can purchase BluePower products via credit card. Please contact our sales team at <a href="mailto:sales@bluepowersolutions.com" _href="mailto:sales@bluepowersolutions.com">sales@bluepowersolutions.com</a> for information regarding additional payment methods.</p>

            <h4>How do you deliver your products?</h4>
	    <p>After you place and pay the order, we will generate a license and send it to you based on the Server Code or Site Collection ID/Farm ID you provided.</p>

            <h4>What is your refund policy?</h4>
            <p>A request for a refund will only be granted if it is received BEFORE the license code has been sent. Once BluePower has sent you a license code, the sale is considered final. The key reason is that we make available a fully-functional trial version
                of the product for download and testing -- with no disabled features. This trial version expires after 30 days. We feel that this should allow any potential customer to fully test and familiarize themselves with the product before making a purchase
                decision.</p>

            <h4>Does BluePower offer a discount for non-profit organizations or educational institutions?</h4>
	    <p>Yes, BluePower can offer discounts on the condition that you can provide proof that your organization is a registered non-profit or educational institution, please contact <a href="mailto:sales@bluepowersolutions.com" _href="mailto:sales@bluepowersolutions.com">sales@bluepowersolutins.com</a> for the discount.<p>

        <h3>Questions About License</h3>
      <div>
            <!-- <h4>What is the difference between a Server License and a Site Collection License/Farm License?</h4>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Server License:</strong> Each Web Front-End (WFE) will require a Server License (For SharePoint 2007: all servers running the SP Web Application service will need to be licensed; for SharePoint 2010: all servers running the "Microsoft SharePoint
            Foundation Web Application" service will need to be licensed). BluePower Server Licenses do NOT limit the number of end-users.</p>
        <p><strong>Farm License: </strong>A Farm License can be used across all site collections within a SharePoint farm. BluePower Farm Licenses do NOT limit the number of end-users.</p>
        <p><strong>Site Collection License: </strong>A Site Collection License (with end-user number limit) can be applied to one site collection only, you would need to make sure the number of end-users is within the end-user number limit provided by your license.</p>
  </div> -->
  <h4>Is ther a limitation on the count of end users? </h4>
<div>
    Currently we call our license as Farm License, which means it can be used across all site collections within a SharePoint farm. BluePower Farm Licenses do NOT limit the number of end-users.
</div>
<h4>What is the process to get a license? </h4>
<div>
  <ol>
    <li>You need to pay by cliking on the "Buy Now" button on the product page.</li>
    <li>Send your Farm ID to  <a href="mailto:sales@bluepowersolutions.com" >sales@bluepowersolutions.com</a>.</li>
    <li>After we get your email, we will send you the license of our product.</li>
  </ol>
</div>
        <h4>How do I find my Farm ID?</h4>
        <p>To find your Farm ID, please check the license management page which will appear after you install the trial version of our software on your SharePoint servers. Need further help about this information, please email
            to <a href="mailto:support@bluepowersolutions.com" _href="mailto:support@bluepowersolutions.com">support@bluepowersolutions.com</a>.</p>

        <h4>I purchased a SharePoint 2010 license and will be migrating to SharePoint 2013. Do I need to purchase a new license?</h4>
        <p>It depends. If you have purchased BluePower Premium Annual Support, it is free to migrate from SharePoint 2010 to SharePoint 2013. If not, you need to either purchase a new license or Premium Annual Support.</p>

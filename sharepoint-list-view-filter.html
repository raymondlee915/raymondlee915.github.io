			    <h3>Product Introduction</h3>
			    <p>With this SharePoint List View Filter you can easily and effectively filter items in a SharePoint List View.
		SharePoint’s out of the box view filter feature is very weak as it only supports users to filter items by descending and ascending order, or by a quite general list of options. What’s more is that the filter condition is only applied to the current page of the SharePoint list view. Most people may become unglued when it comes to filtering some specific information from a large amount of items that are displayed in a SharePoint list view. Then the question arises: how to filter items easily and effectively? Here we introduce you SharePoint List View Filter add-on to solve this issue.

## Summary
We understand the importance of privacy for individuals, and as a software provider, we have a duty to help our customers protect their privacy. This Privacy Policy statement applies to all products developed by BluePower Solutions.

## What information do we collect?
The only information we collect is related to your purchase. This includes the name of your organization, country, and state/province. We do not collect any other information such as email addresses, names, or phone numbers if you purchased our products from the Microsoft Office Store.

During the runtime of our products, there is a possibility that the email address or other information may be exposed by the SharePoint Profile services. However, we do not collect any of this information. SharePoint add-ins have their own mechanisms in place to protect against sending information to third-party servers. The only remote address our products access is a web service provided by Microsoft to verify the license you are using.

## Updating this statement
BluePower Solutions may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We recommend checking this page occasionally to stay informed about any changes. If you have contacted us via email, we will also notify you via email about any changes made to the Privacy Policy.

## Contact us
If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy at any time, you are more than welcome to contact us via email at support@offiaid.com.

Please note that this is a general overview of the changes made to your Privacy Policy, and it is always important to consider your specific legal requirements and consult with legal professionals to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
